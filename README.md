# lycanthrope-log
A console app that is used to log the activities of a particular individual who often turns into a werewolf. 
The code is then created to calculate the individual correlation of each event with his tendency to turn and to then check out which particular event has the most tendency to cause him to turn.

This was done with a lot of aid from Marijn Haverbeke's Eloquent Javascript: A Modern Introduction to Programming.
